#Tik-Tac-Toe Project

#Repository in Progress

Lets dive into the React Documentation and practice going through documentation, reading, and understand
what your building. And what better way to do it then, coding a Tik Tac Toe game based off the docs.

I find this project a learning experience when it comes to getting more familiar with react fundamentals, as well as a chance to get in the holiday spirit..!
