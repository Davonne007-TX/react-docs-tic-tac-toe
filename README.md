#Tik-Tac-Toe Project

Deployed Site: https://tikati-tak.netlify.app/

Lets dive into the React Docs and practice going through documentation, reading, and understanding what your building. And what better way to do it then, coding a Tik-Tac-Toe game based off the docs. With this project, I was able to review state with useState, props, passing down props, as well as coming up with a simple design for my Tik-Tac-Toe game. It was a lot of fun to build and I was able to go over the basics of React. I'll definitely come back to this adding more features (more features from the docs and my own), and optimizing the code, or if you would like to add something, let me know and go for it..! Below is the link to the React Documentation.
